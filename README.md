FEATURES OF THE PROJECT

User login – The name tells you exactly what this function does. It lets the user and the admin login. The first login is always the administrator login, and the password is always admin.

User menu – The user menu shows all of the books that the user has checked out or borrowed.

Admin menu – The Administrator has access to everything in the system and can do things like add books and users, delete and edit books, return books, get information about users and books, and create and reset the database.

Output menu – The answers to all your queries will be shown on the output menu. When you first log in, your ID and password would be for admin, and your username and password would also be admin.

View books – By choosing this option, you’ll see information about the books in the table, such as the title, genre, price, subject, author, copyright, publisher, edition pages, ISBN, and other information that may be in the database.

View Members, Students, and Users – The system displays the users along with their information, including who would receive the books and their current status (issued, returned, and pending).

Add user – To add a new user system, click “Add User” and choose whether the new user will be an administrator or a regular user. Under “view users,” you can see information about all of the users.

Issue a book – To issue a student, member, or user a book, you must click the “issue book” button and enter the book’s details, such as the book’s id, the user’s id, the number of days the book can be used, the date it must be returned, etc. After putting in the necessary information, you click “submit,” which finishes the process.

View issued books – After you issue the book using the steps in the previous paragraph, you can use this feature to see all the books that have been issued along with their details.

Return books – After you choose the option to return books, you will need to enter the book’s ID and choose a date from the calendar.
This can be said in two different ways: If the book is returned on time, the message “book returned” will be shown. If the book isn’t returned by the date given, the system will show a message about the fine and the amount that needs to be paid.

Add books – All the information about the book, like its name, price, and genre, can be added to the system here. After that, you can see it in the “view books” section.
